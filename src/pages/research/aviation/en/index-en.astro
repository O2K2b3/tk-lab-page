        Takahashi Laboratory is one of the only laboratories in Japan<br />
        that conducts practical and academic research on human factors in Air Traffic
        Control.

          This research group aims to further improve the safety of large-scale
          complex systems, including those in the aviation field, and works
          closely with airlines and other organizations to conduct academic
          research on "resilience," which is the key to realizing Safety-II. We
          conduct practical research that goes beyond knowledge. Below are some
          of the research actually being conducted in this group.
        </p>
        <p class="my-10 text-center">
          Takahashi Lab has been conducting research on aviation-related human
          factors for over 10 years. In our early research, we worked with
          current ANA pilots on aircraft cockpit interfaces. After that, We
          shifted the focus of my research to the field of air traffic control,
          and are conducting research in collaboration with active air traffic
          controllers. Although those of us who conduct research are required to
          have a high level of knowledge regarding air traffic control, the
          content of our research is not merely academic research, such as
          proposing a system that is highly evaluated as being usable for
          on-site education. We conduct practical research that goes beyond
          human factors in air traffic control. These issues are very important
          to protect air safety, but there is a shortage of human resources.<br

Traditionally, we have focused on "events that did not go well", but by focusing on and analyzing the actions that were the cause of "successful events", which are the majority of daily operations, we are researching new approaches to safety that aim to achieve higher levels of safety by increasing success.'

Using interviews and qualitative research methods, we will systematize and visualize the competencies for resilience possessed by flight crew members (pilots), and utilize the knowledge gained from this for future education and training, and ultimately for even safer flight operations. We are conducting practical research aimed at achieving this goal."

            detail='As a safety measure for various complex systems, "prevention of failures from recurring" has been emphasized. It is of course important to prevent safety-related failures, but if the pursuit of higher safety leads to the creation of an organizational culture where even the smallest failures are not tolerated, employees will not have the opportunity to learn from small failures and improve their skills. Will it really lead to further improvements in system security? Does it really contribute to maintaining system safety under various conditions, including unexpected events? In this study, as a first step toward answering these questions, we used a unique task simulator to study the impact that differences in tolerance for failure have on the flexibility of skills acquired through education, training, and experience.'
